what would should i do for humanity? to be a right person? huh?
where is my apttite for eating the food i loved?
why all the humand act like they are in charge of everything?
what is that the humans exactly wants from the animals? leave the animals alone you morans!!
where is the humity going? i see nothing...
why the whole world want to improve himself, why on earth everyone wants to show the person thet the aren't;
Maybe the reason for people to keep striving to show themselves is that they have nothing to do...
